     n_quantiles : int, optional (default=1000)
         Number of quantiles to be computed. It corresponds to the number
         of landmarks used to discretize the cumulative distribution function.
+        Ideally, `n_quantiles` should be equal to the number of samples in the
+        training dataset (`n_samples`) to perfectly represent its distribution.
+        Choosing `n_quantiles` greater than `n_samples` does not provide any
+        additional information and is not recommended as it introduces unnecessary
+        computational complexity without improving the quality of the transformation.
+        When `n_samples` is very large, it may be computationally efficient to choose
+        `n_quantiles` less than `n_samples` for an approximate representation of the
