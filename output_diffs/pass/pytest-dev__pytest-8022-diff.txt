+# Doctest Collection Issue Fix Documentation
+
+## Issue Summary
+There was an issue in the pytest codebase where running `pytest --doctest-modules __init__.py` would only collect a single doctest from the `__init__.py` file. This was due to a special case handling in the `main.py` file that prematurely stopped the collection process after the first doctest was collected.
+
+## Changes Made
+The special case handling logic was located in `main.py` between lines 768-781. The code was designed to yield only the first item from the collection of the `__init__.py` module, which caused the issue.
+
+The following changes were made to `main.py`:
+- Removed the conditional check for `argpath.basename == "__init__.py"`.
+- Removed the logic that yielded only the first collected item and returned.
+- Ensured that `yield from matching` is the only line that executes for any Python module file, allowing all doctests to be collected.
+
+## Testing Process
+To test the changes, a doctest was added to an existing `__init__.py` file within the `testing/example_scripts/collect/package_init_given_as_arg/pkg/` directory. The pytest command was then run with the `--doctest-modules` option to ensure that the doctest was collected and executed.
+
+## Test Results
+The test results confirmed that the issue was resolved:
+- The pytest command collected 2 items, including the doctest in `__init__.py`.
+- The doctest added for testing purposes passed successfully.
+
+## Conclusion
+The doctest collection issue in `__init__.py` files has been successfully resolved with the changes made to the `main.py` file. The pytest framework should now correctly collect all doctests from `__init__.py` files when the `--doctest-modules` option is used.
